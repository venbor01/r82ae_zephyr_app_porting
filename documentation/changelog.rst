***********************
Refactoring and Porting
***********************

This version represents a major refactoring and porting of the original
Actuation Demo. The project has been restructured to directly integrate Autoware
components into the Zephyr application.

New Features
============

- Direct integration of Autoware modules into the Zephyr application.
- Simplified build system.
- Updated documentation to reflect the new project structure.

Changed
=======

- Removed the dependency on a separate Autoware workspace and pre-compiled
  binaries. Autoware components are now compiled as part of the Zephyr
  application.
- Replaced the ROS2-based "Message Converter" and "Actuation Player" with direct
  DDS communication and integrated control logic.
- The project is now structured as a standalone Zephyr application with Autoware
  libraries.

******
latest
******

New Features
============

- New ``fvp_baser_aemv8r_smp`` Zephyr target for the Actuation Service.

- New AVH platform deployment, leveraging the ``fvp_baser_aemv8r_smp`` Zephyr
  target support.

    branch: kirkstone-dev

Changed
=======

- Removed Autoware submodule. The demo now relies on pre-compiled binaries.

****
v2.0
****

New Features
============

- Added new components to the repository. They allow creating a lighter
  deployment of the Safety Island Actuation Demo, without running the Autoware
  pipeline on the Primary Compute and using a recording of the messages instead.

  - An Actuation Player component that reads back recorded messages and sends
    them as DDS messages.

  - A Packet Analyzer that validates actuation commands against reference ones.

    name:   meta-ewaol
    url:    https://gitlab.com/soafee/ewaol/meta-ewaol.git
    branch: kirkstone-dev

Changed
=======

- Simplified and improved the steps of the user guide to reproduce the demo.

  - New Dockerfile to simplify the reproduce steps for the user.

  - Steps using the IDE to flash the development board replaced with using a
    command line interface.

- Updated the version of third party repositories.

  - Autoware updated to the 2023.10 release, which updates the underlying ROS2
    version from Galactic to Humble.

  - Zephyr updated to the 3.5.0 release. The targeted commit is ahead of the
    release in order to include patches providing better support for the S32Z
    board.

  - CycloneDDS updated to support the latest Zephyr version.

- Started using distinct ROS domain IDs for the Autoware pipeline on the Primary
  Compute and the Actuation Service on the Safety Island.

Limitations
===========

- A devicetree overlay ``actuation_autoware/boards/s32z270dc2_rtu0_r52.overlay`` is used
  to set the MAC address of the NXP S32Z270DC2_R52 board. This is done as a
  workaround as the NXP S32Z270DC2_R52 platform uses the same MAC address for
  every build (issue tracked in `Zephyr Project#61478
  <https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/issues/61478>`_).

- The AVA Developer Platform and S32Z need to be on the same sub-network.

- Rendering issues with the ``rviz2`` program used by the Autoware demo have
  been observed on specific GPU and driver combinations. In particular, machines
  with `NVIDIA Optimus <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_Optimus>`_
  technology have been seen to error with ``libGL error: failed to create
  drawable`` lines leading to a crash of the program. There are no known
  workarounds apart from using a different machine to do the render.

Known Issues
============

None

Resolved Issues
===============

- The known issue of the 1.0 release requiring to re-flash the demo after each
  run has been resolved.

- Official support has been added to Zephyr for the S32 Debug Probe. The need
  for launching the S32 Design Studio IDE and the workaround involving user
  action to set system registers to the correct value have been removed.

****
v1.0
****

New Features
============

- First release.

  - Pure Pursuit as the Zephyr application, autoware.universe as the main pipeline.
